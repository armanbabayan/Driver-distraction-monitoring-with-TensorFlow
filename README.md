# Driver distraction monitoring with TensorFlow

## Overview
In this project I am making driver distraction monitoring using custom neural network constructed with TensorFlow. 
Model trained on google colab using single Tesla T4 GPU.
## Data

The data for training the model was taken from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/data).
The data set has been shortened a little. This dataset has 10 classes with nearly 1000 images in each class.
